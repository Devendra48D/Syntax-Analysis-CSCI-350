iii) Instructions to compile the program

1) Clone all the files from the Github repository to a folder.
2) Open the Terminal and go to the folder for the repository.
3) Make sure that all the files are in the folder.
4) Use the command below in Terminal to compile the program
gcc parser.c -o parser
5) After the program is compiled use the command below in Terminal to run the program
./parser <file_name>
where <file_name> should be replaced by the real file name. In this case, where the input file is front.in the command to be entered would be 
./parser front.in
to run the program on the input from front.in


iv) More information

When running the program, make sure to use 
./parser <file_name> 
where <file_name> is replaced by the actual file name. The ./ should not be missing. 
Make sure that all the files in the folder are present from the repository for proper functioning of the program.
